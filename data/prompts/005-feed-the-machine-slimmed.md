## 🛠️ Technical Details

<!-- Specify technologies, frameworks, or constraints -->
**Tech Stack:**
<!-- Example: React 18, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS -->


<!-- Any architectural requirements or existing code patterns to follow -->
**Constraints:**
<!-- Example: Must use existing API patterns, follow ESLint config, work with current Docker setup -->


<!-- Current file structure or where new code should go -->
**Integration Points:**
<!-- Example: Integrates with src/utils/api.js, should modify src/components/ProtectedRoute.js -->


---

## 📐 Implementation Specs

<!-- For new features: describe functionality in detail -->
<!-- For bugs: describe current behavior vs expected behavior -->
<!-- For refactors: describe what should be improved and why -->

**Detailed Requirements:**


<!-- If relevant: data models, API endpoints, or database changes needed -->
**Data/API Specifications:**
<!-- Example: User model needs {id, email, password, role}, POST /api/auth/login endpoint -->


<!-- If relevant: UI/UX requirements or user flow -->
**UI/UX Requirements:**
<!-- Example: Login form with email/password fields, loading states, error handling -->


---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

<!-- What should be tested and how -->
**Testing Requirements:**
<!-- Example: Unit tests for auth utils, integration test for login flow -->


<!-- Security considerations if applicable -->
**Security/Performance Notes:**
<!-- Example: Hash passwords with bcrypt, validate all inputs, rate limit login attempts -->


---

## 📎 Additional Context

<!-- Links to designs, documentation, or related issues -->
**Resources:**
<!-- Example: Design mockups: [link], API docs: [link], Related issue: #123 -->


<!-- Any assumptions, preferences, or future considerations -->
**Notes:**
<!-- Example: Assume email service configured, prefer functional components, may add 2FA later -->


<!-- Questions for the implementer -->
**Questions:**
<!-- Example: Should I implement frontend and backend, or just one? Any specific browser requirements? -->
